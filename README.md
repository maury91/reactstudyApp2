# Personal repo for exercise with React

After some time I choose to make publics these repositories, you can find them in my Account, they are all called "reactStudyApp{n}".

The code on this repository is based on the book "Fullstack React" (https://www.fullstackreact.com/) and the React course available on codeschool.

I am developing the exercises of the book using ES7 + Babel transpiling on the server side. 

You can see the solution proposed by the book on the file app-complete.js and my solution on the folder src.
